# GAN
 Simple implementation of a GAN in python using keras. The old repository https://github.com/jhayes14/GAN was used as a reference to create this architecture.


 The model was coded and tested using the dataset ExtYaleCroppedPNG uploaded to kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tbourton/extyalebcroppedpng/data obtaining fair results even considering the fact that the data is diverse and different levels of ilumination can be found in the dataset. Also, the data is grayscale while the GAN was trained considering RGB data output and not grayscale (which would have made the training even faster and better results could have been obtained).

 This simple implementation can be used to produce images, either for a sample generation problem or for simply producing new images similar to the ones found in a dataset.

 An example of the obtained results:
